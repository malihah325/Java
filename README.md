This is a Library Management System developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and best practices. The system allows library administrators to manage books, track borrowing and returning activities, and maintain user records. It includes features such as:

📖 Book inventory management (add, borrow, return)

👩‍🎓 User registration and library card assignment

📅 Borrowing rules for students and teachers

⏱️ Late fee calculation and tracking

📝 Borrowed books list

♻️ Reusable user library cards with ID tracking

The project demonstrates the use of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and SOLID principles, making it a great example of real-world Java application development.
